EDA Cars Data Analysis

Project Overview

This project involves conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing various attributes of cars. The analysis aims to understand the data better through visualizations and to identify relationships between different variables. The ultimate goal is to perform a multivariate analysis with Price as the dependent variable and predictors like EngineSize, Horsepower, and MPG.city.

Data Preprocessing

1. Handling Missing Values: 
   - Checked for null values in the dataset.
   - Treated missing values using the mode for categorical variables and the mean for continuous variables.

2. Categorical and Continuous Variables:
   - Separated the dataset into categorical and continuous variables for more precise analysis and visualization.

Univariate Analysis

Used various visualization techniques to understand the distribution of individual variables:

- Histogram: To observe the frequency distribution of continuous variables.
- Bar Plot: To compare the categorical variables.
- Count Plot: To count the occurrences of categorical values.

Bivariate Analysis

Examined relationships between two variables using:

- Scatter Plot: To explore the relationship between continuous variables.
- Heatmap: To visualize the correlation matrix.
- Correlation: To quantify the strength of relationships between variables.
- Box Plot: To compare distributions across categories.
- Crosstab: To examine the relationship between two categorical variables.

Multivariate Analysis

Conducted a multivariate analysis with Price as the dependent variable and EngineSize, Horsepower, and MPG.city as predictors:

- Explored how these predictors interact with each other and their combined effect on the Price of cars.
- Utilized visualizations to better understand these relationships.

Tools and Libraries

- Python: The primary programming language used.
- Libraries: 
  - numpy and pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
  - matplotlib and seaborn for creating visualizations.
